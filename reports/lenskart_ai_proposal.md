Moreover, the AI healthcare market is expected to reach $22.7 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 47.2% from 2018 to 2023 [(ReportsnReports, 2019)](https://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/1415214-artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-market-by-component-hardware-software-services-application-diagnosis-monitoring-therapy-end-user-and-region-global-forecast-to-2023.html). The major factors driving the growth of the AI healthcare market include the increasing demand for personalized medicine, the growing need for cost-effective disease diagnosis and treatment, and the surging need for real-time patient monitoring.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: AI-Powered Fraud Detection in Banking

According to a recent report, the global AI in banking market is expected to reach $35.3 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 23.37% from 2020 to 2026 [(Mordor Intelligence, 2020)](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/artificial-intelligence-in-banking-market). One of the major applications of AI in banking is fraud detection. AI-powered fraud detection systems can analyze large volumes of data in real-time and identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities. For example, MasterCard has developed an AI-powered fraud detection system called "Decision Intelligence" that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify potential fraud [(MasterCard, 2020)](https://newsroom.mastercard.com/news/mastercard-announces-decision-intelligence-a-game-changer-in-fraud-detection/).

### Use Case 2: AI-Powered Diagnosis and Treatment in Healthcare

As mentioned earlier, the AI healthcare market is expected to reach $22.7 billion by 2023. One of the major applications of AI in healthcare is diagnosis and treatment. AI-powered diagnosis and treatment systems can analyze large volumes of medical data and identify patterns and anomalies that indicate diseases and their causes. For example, IBM Watson Health has developed an AI-powered diagnosis and treatment system called "Watson for Oncology" that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze medical records and identify the most effective treatment options for cancer patients [(IBM Watson Health, 2020)](https://www.ibm.com/watson-health/oncology-and-genomics).

### Use Case 3: AI-Powered Customer Service in Retail

According to a recent report, the global AI in retail market is expected to reach $19.9 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 39.7% from 2020 to 2027 [(Meticulous Research, 2020)](https://www.meticulousresearch.com/download-sample-report/artificial-intelligence-in-retail-market.html). One of the major applications of AI in retail is customer service. AI-powered customer service systems can analyze large volumes of customer data in real-time and provide personalized recommendations and support. For example, Amazon has developed an AI-powered customer service system called "Amazon Personalize" that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and provide personalized product recommendations [(Amazon Web Services, 2020)](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/).

## Conclusion
