## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: AI-powered chatbots in customer service

Implementing AI-powered chatbots can help companies to improve their customer service by providing quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries. Chatbots can handle a high volume of requests and can be available 24/7, which can help companies to reduce their customer service costs and improve customer satisfaction.

Here are some practical examples of AI-powered chatbots in customer service:

* [Amtrak's AI-powered chatbot Julie](https://www.amtrak.com/chatbot.html) has helped the company to reduce its customer service costs by 30% and to increase customer satisfaction by providing quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries.
* [The Royal Bank of Scotland's AI-powered chatbot Cora](https://www.rbs.com/rbs/0100/news/2017/april/rbs-launches-ai-powered-virtual-assistant-for-customers.html) has helped the bank to reduce its customer service calls by 20% and to improve customer engagement by providing personalized financial advice.

### Use Case 2: AI-powered image recognition in retail

Implementing AI-powered image recognition can help retailers to improve their inventory management and to provide personalized product recommendations to customers. Image recognition can help retailers to identify products that are out of stock or misplaced, and can provide recommendations based on the products that customers have previously purchased or viewed.

Here are some practical examples of AI-powered image recognition in retail:

* [Amazon Go](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation/amazon-go-how-it-works) is a cashier-less store that uses image recognition and other AI technologies to enable customers to pick up products and leave the store without having to wait in line or scan items.
* [Sephora's Visual Artist](https://www.sephora.com/visual-artist) is an AI-powered app that allows customers to try on makeup products virtually and to receive personalized product recommendations based on their skin tone and preferred styles.

### Use Case 3: AI-powered fraud detection in banking

Implementing AI-powered fraud detection can help banks to improve their security and to reduce fraud losses. Fraud detection can help banks to identify suspicious transactions and to take action before any damage is done.

Here are some practical examples of AI-powered fraud detection in banking:

* [Mastercard's AI-powered fraud detection system](https://newsroom.mastercard.com/news/mastercard-introduces-new-ai-powered-tool-to-help-banks-fight-fraud/) has helped the company to reduce fraud losses by 50% and to improve its fraud detection accuracy by 30%.
